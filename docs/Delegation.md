# ðŸ¥­ Entropy Explorer

# ðŸ”¥ Delegation

Entropy Account Delegation is a feature that allows a separate account limited access to the Entropy Account's features.

Delegation can provide some additional security for more sophisticated key management procedures.

A delegated account _can_, for example:

- Deposit funds
- Place orders
- Cancel orders

A delegated account _cannot_, for example:

- Withdraw funds
- Close the Entropy Account

A Entropy Account can have at most one delegate. The owner of the Entropy Account continues to have full control of the Entropy Account irrespective of delegation.

# ðŸ†’ Commands

`entropy-explorer` provides two commands for delegation: `delegate-account` and `show-delegated-accounts`.

You can see exactly what additional parameters a command takes by specifying the `--help` parameter.

## `delegate-account`

> Accepts parameter: `--account-address <ACCOUNT-PUBLIC-KEY>` (required, `PublicKey`, no default)

> Accepts parameter: `--delegate-address <DELEGATE-PUBLIC-KEY>` (optional, `PublicKey`, no default)

> Accepts parameter: `--revoke` (optional, TRUE if specified otherwise FALSE)

`delegate-account` allows you to set or revoke delegation of a Entropy Account. It must be run by the owner of the Entropy Account.

## `show-delegated-accounts`

> Accepts parameter: `--address <DELEGATE-PUBLIC-KEY>` (optional, `PublicKey`, default value: wallet root address)

`show-delegated-accounts` will list all accounts for which the current wallet is nominated as the delegate. **It will not** list accounts _owned_ by the current wallet, only those in which it is listed as a delegate.

# âœ… Example Walkthrough

To run this walkthrough, you need to set up 2 different Solana wallets and 1 Entropy Account. Choose one of the wallets as the Owner and use it to create a Entropy Account. The other wallet is the Delegate.

In these examples,

- `ALBdwdFnHsmTAQ3xGqkDK8hcTMXeuMNyCNkz1ikBzv3L` is the address of the Entropy Account Owner's wallet
- `7zTdp1YhPdBQw8nFJJXkmTewZf4zPwDbjktKzQLaQr62` is the address of the Entropy Account
- `6aNN6nbAm9Dbqex9kKGAYcMFJg7Jhertwew9JhRv4QfB` is the address of Delegate's wallet

## Show No Delegate

_Run as Owner of the Entropy Account_

This command will show the Entropy Account, including what account (if any) is listed as a delegate:

```
show-accounts
```

This will output something like (abridged):

```
Â« Account (un-named), Version.V3 [7zTdp1YhPdBQw8nFJJXkmTewZf4zPwDbjktKzQLaQr62]
    Â« Metadata Version.V2 - Account: Initialized Â»
    Owner: ALBdwdFnHsmTAQ3xGqkDK8hcTMXeuMNyCNkz1ikBzv3L
    Delegated To: None
```

## Delegate Account

_Run as Owner of the Entropy Account_

This command will grant the Delegate limited access to the Entropy Account:

```
delegate-account --account-address 7zTdp1YhPdBQw8nFJJXkmTewZf4zPwDbjktKzQLaQr62 --delegate-address 6aNN6nbAm9Dbqex9kKGAYcMFJg7Jhertwew9JhRv4QfB
```

## Show Delegate

_Run as Owner of the Entropy Account_

This command will now show the Entropy Account with `6aNN6nbAm9Dbqex9kKGAYcMFJg7Jhertwew9JhRv4QfB` listed as a delegate:

```
show-accounts
```

This will output the address of the Delegate in the 'Delegated To' line (abridged):

```
Â« Account (un-named), Version.V3 [7zTdp1YhPdBQw8nFJJXkmTewZf4zPwDbjktKzQLaQr62]
    Â« Metadata Version.V2 - Account: Initialized Â»
    Owner: ALBdwdFnHsmTAQ3xGqkDK8hcTMXeuMNyCNkz1ikBzv3L
    Delegated To: 6aNN6nbAm9Dbqex9kKGAYcMFJg7Jhertwew9JhRv4QfB
```

## Show Delegated Account

_Run as Delegate_

This command will show all Entropy Accounts with the current user listed as a delegate. If it is run as the user with the wallet address `6aNN6nbAm9Dbqex9kKGAYcMFJg7Jhertwew9JhRv4QfB` (the Delegate)

```
show-delegated-accounts
```

It will show the same output as `show-account` run by the Owner:

```
Â« Account (un-named), Version.V3 [7zTdp1YhPdBQw8nFJJXkmTewZf4zPwDbjktKzQLaQr62]
    Â« Metadata Version.V2 - Account: Initialized Â»
    Owner: ALBdwdFnHsmTAQ3xGqkDK8hcTMXeuMNyCNkz1ikBzv3L
    Delegated To: 6aNN6nbAm9Dbqex9kKGAYcMFJg7Jhertwew9JhRv4QfB
```

## Deposit

_Run as Delegate_

Delegates can deposit funds from their own wallet (not the Owner's wallet).

```
deposit --symbol SOL --quantity 1 --account-address 7zTdp1YhPdBQw8nFJJXkmTewZf4zPwDbjktKzQLaQr62
```

Note that to target an account which has been delegated, the `--account-address` parameter must be specified. (This is the same way an account is specified for wallets that hold multiple Entropy Accounts.)

## Place Order

_Run as Delegate_

Delegates can place and cancel orders using the delegated Entropy Account.

```
place-order --market SOL-PERP --quantity 1 --side BUY --order-type LIMIT --price 10 --skip-preflight --account-address 7zTdp1YhPdBQw8nFJJXkmTewZf4zPwDbjktKzQLaQr62
```

**Note**: it is the Delegate running this command so it is the Delegate that pays the SOL for the transaction.

## Withdraw

_Run as Delegate_

Delegates **cannot** withdraw funds from the delegated Entropy Account. **This will fail**:

```
withdraw --symbol SOL --quantity 1 --account-address 7zTdp1YhPdBQw8nFJJXkmTewZf4zPwDbjktKzQLaQr62
```

**This will fail** with an error containing the following in the transaction logs:

```
Program log: EntropyErrorCode::InvalidOwner; src/processor.rs
```

## Revoke Delegation

_Run as Owner of the Entropy Account_

This command will revoke the delegated authority to the Delegate, removing their access to the Entropy Account:

```
delegate-account --account-address 7zTdp1YhPdBQw8nFJJXkmTewZf4zPwDbjktKzQLaQr62 --revoke
```

## Show No Delegated Accounts

_Run as Delegate_

Running the same command as earlier:

```
show-delegated-accounts
```

Now shows no delegated accounts, since the delegation was revoked:

```
Account 6aNN6nbAm9Dbqex9kKGAYcMFJg7Jhertwew9JhRv4QfB has no accounts delegated to it.
```
