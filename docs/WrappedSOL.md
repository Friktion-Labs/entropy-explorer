# ü•≠ Entropy Explorer

# ‚óé Wrapped SOL

SOL is the native token of the Solana network. [Entropy Markets](https://entropy.markets/) (and [Serum](https://projectserum.com/)) trade Solana's ['SPL' tokens](https://spl.solana.com/) and can't directly trade SOL.

In order to allow trading of SOL, it must first be 'wrapped' in an SPL-compatible account.

This page will show you the commands to create wrapped SOL accounts, wrap SOL, unwrap SOL, view all wrapped SOL accounts, and close wrapped SOL accounts.

(Note: commands in this page assume you have set up a `entropy-explorer` command similar to how it's done in the [Quickstart](../Quickstart.md).)

# 1. ‚ùì What's The Problem?

'Pure' SOL can't be traded directly on [Entropy Markets](https://entropy.markets/) or [Serum](https://projectserum.com/). It must first be 'wrapped' in an SPL-compatible account.

Wallets can have different views on how to handle Wrapped SOL - some hide it, some transparently convert it and you never see the transient accounts, and some convert it but leave a Wrapped SOL account with a zero balance around for next time.

The liquidator keeps SOL and Wrapped SOL separate. This allows you to allocate a particular amount of Wrapped SOL to liquidating, and have it take part in rebalancing. You can see this if you run the `group-balances` command, e.g.:

```
# entropy-explorer group-balances --group-name BTC_ETH_SOL_SRM_USDC

# 2. üïµÔ∏è How Do I See What Wrapped SOL Accounts I Have?

Depending on what wallets you have used with your account, you may already have one or more 'Wrapped SOL' accounts, possibly with your Wrapped SOL shared across them. The liquidator can't use the combined balance of these accounts, so it will pick the account with the biggest balance. It's often simplest to combine these accounts so there is a single Wrapped SOL account.

You can see what Wrapped SOL accounts you have by using the `show-wrapped-sol` command, e.g.:

```
# entropy-explorer show-wrapped-sol
2021-06-08 13:25:54 ‚ö† root

# 3. üìí How Do I Create A Wrapped SOL Account?

Creating a Wrapped SOL account is cheap and easy, as long as you have SOL in your account to wrap. Let's say these are the current balances:

```
# entropy-explorer group-balances --group-name BTC_ETH_SOL_SRM_USDC

        0.00000000 Serum
        5.81632200 USD Coin
```

(It's an old account I'm not using for liquidations.)

Let's create a Wrapped SOL sub-account and 'wrap' 1 SOL from this account, using the `wrap-sol` command:

```
# entropy-explorer wrap-sol --quantity 1

```

This adds to the largest Wrapped SOL sub-account that exists for the account, and will automatically create a Wrapped SOL account if none exist.

Now the Group balances are:

```
# entropy-explorer group-balances --group-name BTC_ETH_SOL_SRM_USDC

        0.00000000 Serum
        5.81632200 USD Coin
```

You can see a Wrapped SOL account has been created and now holds exactly 1.0 Wrapped SOL.

# 4. üéÅ How Do I Wrap SOL?

Wrapping SOL when you already have a Wrapped SOL account is exactly the same as wrapping SOL when you don't have a Wrapped SOL account - you still just use the `wrap-sol` command.

For example, for an account with 1.0 Wrapped SOL:

```
# entropy-explorer show-wrapped-sol

```

An additional `wrap-sol` command will just add Wrapped SOL to that same account:

```

There are now 2.0 Wrapped SOL, and it's still using the same Wrapped SOL account address.

# 5. üìñ How Do I Unrap SOL

Unwrapping SOL is the converse of wrapping it, and the command is `unwrap-sol`. This command will remove Wrapped SOL from a Wrapped SOL account, and add it as Pure SOL to the main wallet address.

For example:

```
# entropy-explorer unwrap-sol --quantity 1

# 6. üî• How Do I Delete A Wrapped SOL Account?

Problems can happen and leave you with multiple Wrapped SOL accounts. Sometimes wallets create them and don't clean them up (accidentally or deliberately), sometimes programs crash.

Whatever the reason, you can see all the Wrapped SOL sub-accounts for your account by using `show-wrapped-sol`. For example, you can see here there are 2 Wrapped SOL sub-accounts:

```

```

The liquidator is only able to effectively use one of these, so it'll pick the largest.

It's often better to remove confusion by having just one Wrapped SOL account for the liquidator account.

The `close-wrapped-sol-account` will unwrap all the SOL, transfer that Pure SOL to the main wallet account, and then close the (now empty) Wrapped SOL account.

For example, to close the above '4dqnZ8MgT1AZksAixHha117DVPEBUJZ89V5MAgoYmzh9' with 1.0 Wrapped SOL in it:

```
# entropy-explorer close-wrapped-sol-account --address 4dqnZ8MgT1AZksAixHha117DVPEBUJZ89V5MAgoYmzh9
